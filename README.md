## TODO (MVP)
* mobile friendliness
* get spotify links to open in app?
* move list to table, for sorting
    * https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/sortable-tables-react/
    * could sort on popularity etc in addition to chronological? Not sure this is needed.
* ~~Add birth/year~~
* ~~get playlist links back onto daily pages~~
* ~~deal with missing images~~
* ~~style results~~
* ~~style header~~
* Occasional crazy timeouts (15s)
    * something funky with e.g. http://localhost:8000/7-31
    * `gatsby clean` fixed it
* ~~check in and deploy~~
* ~~Remove "Home" and replace with "Today".~~
* ~~Day template doesn't correctly set page title (browser tab has a | in it)~~

## TODO (feature wishes)
* add composers by death day
* get data from google sheets instead of cooked csv/json
* calendar-type page?
* ical downloads
* add page for charts etc?
* piece premieres
* female composer page?
* use "top tier" to sort best composers to top of day?
